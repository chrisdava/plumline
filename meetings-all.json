As an important part of our practice, we endeavor to create trust within our circle and hold in confidence what is shared to encourage speaking from our heart and listening to each other.

    "notes": "We are a sangha in the Plum Village tradition, our teacher is Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk Thich Naht Hanh (Thay) who passed away in January 2022. Thich Naht Hanh is one of the most prominent spiritual teachers of the 20th century. He was a peace activist, poet, author and most importantly a sangha builder. His teachings about mindfulness are unsurpassed. Lotus Bud Sangha was established by our dear Vietnamese dharma teachers in the 1980s who wanted to share this practice with the Vietnamese community and the wider Australian community. From those small but powerful beginnings we have a number of lay sanghas in Sydney and now our own meditation centre Mountain Spring Monastery at Bilpin.We would love to have you practice with us. What is practicing you may ask? In our sangha (community of meditators) we practice sitting and walking meditation, learn about the dharma (Buddhist teachings) and share about our experiences on the path of practice. We welcome beginners and experienced meditators as we learn from each other wherever we are in our practice. The group of regular facilitators at Lotus Buds are experienced meditators in the Plum Village tradition. We have been taught and guided by dharma teacher John Barclay who received the lamp transmission from Thich Nhat Hanh. John has been leading the sangha for many years, by teaching the dharma and mentoring many of us. He is also a Buddhist scripture teacher to primary and secondary students in Sydney. Meditation can be challenging at times however being in a sangha supports our practice and makes it easier. Being in a sangha with friends with shared values and a shared practice brings us joy and gives us energy. With weekly practice and spiritual friendships the path becomes easier and more beautiful.Each Wednesday we practice sitting and walking mediation, recite trainings, or explore a teaching and share our reflections. Most importantly we learn about how meditation and the Plum Village practices can help us in our daily lives. Thich Nhat Hanh’s teachings help us to transform our suffering so we can become more peaceful and happy. Wherever you may be in your meditation practice you are welcome to join us.",
