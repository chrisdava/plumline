The general Sangha format starts with both children and adults signing practice songs, followed by group walking meditation, then a short guided meditation from the Plum Village app. Then the children separate for their own program while the adults practice silent sitting meditation, followed by a Dharma offering and ending with a focus on Dharma Sharing. Dharma Offerings are: 1st Sunday - 5 MT recitation, 2nd Sunday - Chanting or Touching the Earth, 3rd Sunday - Children's Program for all, 4th Sunday - Discourse Reading, 5th Sunday - Deep Relaxation.",
