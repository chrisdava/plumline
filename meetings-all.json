After a short break, we will enjoy a talk, or a reading followed by group sharing (dharma sharing) about our mindfulness and meditation practice and how it influences our daily life and our interactions with the world around us. As an important part of our practice, we endeavor to create trust within our circle and hold in confidence what is shared to encourage speaking from our heart and listening to each other. We do not give advice nor engage in a debate. Dharma sharing is a practice in deep listening and loving speech. Please review the Peace in Our Hearts Sitting Group Sharing Guidelines.

    "notes": "We are a sangha in the Plum Village tradition, our teacher is Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk Thich Naht Hanh (Thay) who passed away in January 2022. Thich Naht Hanh is one of the most prominent spiritual teachers of the 20th century. He was a peace activist, poet, author and most importantly a sangha builder. His teachings about mindfulness are unsurpassed. Lotus Bud Sangha was established by our dear Vietnamese dharma teachers in the 1980s who wanted to share this practice with the Vietnamese community and the wider Australian community. From those small but powerful beginnings we have a number of lay sanghas in Sydney and now our own meditation centre Mountain Spring Monastery at Bilpin.We would love to have you practice with us. What is practicing you may ask? In our sangha (community of meditators) we practice sitting and walking meditation, learn about the dharma (Buddhist teachings) and share about our experiences on the path of practice. We welcome beginners and experienced meditators as we learn from each other wherever we are in our practice. The group of regular facilitators at Lotus Buds are experienced meditators in the Plum Village tradition. We have been taught and guided by dharma teacher John Barclay who received the lamp transmission from Thich Nhat Hanh. John has been leading the sangha for many years, by teaching the dharma and mentoring many of us. He is also a Buddhist scripture teacher to primary and secondary students in Sydney. Meditation can be challenging at times however being in a sangha supports our practice and makes it easier. Being in a sangha with friends with shared values and a shared practice brings us joy and gives us energy. With weekly practice and spiritual friendships the path becomes easier and more beautiful.Each Wednesday we practice sitting and walking mediation, recite trainings, or explore a teaching and share our reflections. Most importantly we learn about how meditation and the Plum Village practices can help us in our daily lives. Thich Nhat Hanh’s teachings help us to transform our suffering so we can become more peaceful and happy. Wherever you may be in your meditation practice you are welcome to join us.",

Links to the practices provided by Plum Village UK can be found here: https://plumvillage.uk/Our weekly calendar looks like this:MONDAY MORNINGS: “FROM THE HEART” 08.30Offered via Facebook Live, the “From The Heart” sessions are a time where Andy shares a brief reading from Thay’s books, starting and closing with a brief meditation.

We sit and share some of Thay’s teachings, such as working through a book together. We then meditate on what we have heard and enjoy a time of dharma sharing at the end. The link for these sessions is posted on the Dharma Bell Sangha page, usually the day before the sitting.Attending these practices does not tie you into anything, there are no conditions, expectations, obligations, or requirements and, best of all, there’s no fee! They are simply offered to support us all to progress in our path.Welcome! With a smile, Andy",

We call our practice Values Based Mindifuness because in our understanding mindfulness does not exist without compassion as the fundamental value. We follow the Five Mindfulness Trainings and read them regularly supporting it with recitation of other Thay writings. At the meetings we have 20 minutes of sitting meditation, 20 minutes of walking meditation and 20 minutes of lying meditation followed by Dharma sharing. We organize Humanum Mindfulness Days when we cook, eat,clean and watch Thay's lectures together and follow the 20-20-20 practice scheme twice a day. We are opened to everyone wishing to join us on the path of mindfulness practice.",
