I am hoping to build a community steeped in the Plum Village tradition and growing an OI team to support many local in person people, but also offering our current virtual meetings either as a hybrid meeting or separate way to reach remote connections seeking a solid community focused on mindful living and engaged buddhism. We currently are doing book studies (currently We Were Made For These Times book) and basic sitting meditation. My goal is to build a regular weekly practice of Sitting, Walking, Silent meditation, followed by a Dharma Talk (using books, articles, or videos by Thay and others) to offer a deeper lesson then community discussion time to share. I'd like to offer tea in our discussion time. As we grow I would like to start having Quarterly Days of Mindfulness. I would eventually like to build an annual retreat for the DFW community as we do not have anything like this locally yet. I will be leaning on OI and Dharma Teachers when we get to that stage but right now it is only myself facilitating.",

As an important part of our practice, we endeavor to create trust within our circle and hold in confidence what is shared to encourage speaking from our heart and listening to each other.

We are a growing group of mindfulness practitioners who practice sitting meditation daily in Santa Monica, CA on the beach at Lifeguard Station 22. Dress warm & bring a beach towel or blanket for sitting. We suggest using the Sundial app to pick the ideal time when you want to come sit. Individuals typically sit for 1 to 2 hours at their own comfort and convenience. Practitioners can meet and socialize after the sitting meditation and we may try to coordinate mindful walking and compassionate listening sessions if there is interest. We can discuss our favorite Thich Nhat Hanh books, or how we got started meditating. We would like to suggest that everyone reads some of Thich Nhat Hanh's books (over 30 in english) and that they also download and check out the Plum Village App as a resource. As we all become better practitioners, we'll be able to help each other more. This is really a community run initiative, we're hoping to get it started, but we have no formal leadership structure. This is all about what works for each person, giving us a chance to meet others with similar practices and giving us the opportunity to grow a community (Sangha).",

Thich Naht Hanh is one of the most prominent spiritual teachers of the 20th century. He was a peace activist, poet, author and most importantly a sangha builder. His teachings about mindfulness are unsurpassed. Lotus Bud Sangha was established by our dear Vietnamese dharma teachers in the 1980s who wanted to share this practice with the Vietnamese community and the wider Australian community. From those small but powerful beginnings we have a number of lay sanghas in Sydney and now our own meditation centre Mountain Spring Monastery at Bilpin.We would love to have you practice with us. What is practicing you may ask? In our sangha (community of meditators) we practice sitting and walking meditation, learn about the dharma (Buddhist teachings) and share about our experiences on the path of practice. We welcome beginners and experienced meditators as we learn from each other wherever we are in our practice. The group of regular facilitators at Lotus Buds are experienced meditators in the Plum Village tradition. We have been taught and guided by dharma teacher John Barclay who received the lamp transmission from Thich Nhat Hanh. John has been leading the sangha for many years, by teaching the dharma and mentoring many of us. He is also a Buddhist scripture teacher to primary and secondary students in Sydney. Meditation can be challenging at times however being in a sangha supports our practice and makes it easier. Being in a sangha with friends with shared values and a shared practice brings us joy and gives us energy. With weekly practice and spiritual friendships the path becomes easier and more beautiful.Each Wednesday we practice sitting and walking mediation, recite trainings, or explore a teaching and share our reflections. Most importantly we learn about how meditation and the Plum Village practices can help us in our daily lives. Thich Nhat Hanh’s teachings help us to transform our suffering so we can become more peaceful and happy. Wherever you may be in your meditation practice you are welcome to join us.",

    "Description": "Our Sangha was founded in 2001 by 6 members who had just been to Plum Village, the monastic community in France where Vietnamese Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh (or “Thay”) is based. (“Thay” means “Teacher” in Vietnamese)We meet (in-person and on Zoom) every Thursday evening 6.30-7.30. We are funded by donations quarterly or £2 on the night. In summer we meet at Barham Church Hall, Church Road, Barham, IP6 0PT , and in winter in each others’ homes. After a few minutes discussing business, the evening starts with a guided meditation, led in turn by the members, followed by a Tea Ceremony and a Dharma sharing. In the Dharma sharing we benefit from each other’s insights and experience of the practice. We listen deeply while members share their experiences, and refrain from giving advice. Whatever is shared is confidential.A small Dharma Study group meets every 1 or 2 months, at a member’s home, to watch a DVD of a talk by Thay.We hold a Morning of Mindfulness every 2nd Saturday of the month, 10am-1.00pm. This includes walking meditation, sitting meditation and other activities such as Touching the Earth, watching a video of Thay, Dharma sharing, etc. We all bring food and drink to share. For several years, we have organised an annual weekend retreat, in a hired centre.Any surplus donations are shared between Thay’s charities in Vietnam and the Community of Interbeing’s Practice Centre Project and Bursary Fund.Contact Isabelle for venues (isabellewen@hotmail.com or (01473)422155Our Mindfulness PracticeOur Sangha practises the art of mindfulness. Our breath is an essential element in our practice of mindfulness. It is always with us and unites our body and mind. The sound of the bell is also a central feature as it reminds us to come back to our breath and dwell in the present moment.Sitting meditation – There are many different postures recommended for sitting meditation. Thay recommends that we adopt a position where we feel comfortable and alert. This maybe cross-legged on a cushion, legs tucked underneath a stool or sitting upright on an ordinary chair. The breath should be deep and light. Our back should be straight. Our hands resting lightly in our lap or our knees. Our eyes can be lightly open or closed, and our mouth ideally in a gentle smile.The period of meditation begins with 3 sounds of the bell and is brought to a close with 3 sounds of the bell.Walking Meditation – When we practise walking meditation the breath is co-ordinated with our steps. When we hear the bell to start we take an in-breath and make one step with the left foot. On the out breath we take another step with the right foot. Then the cycle begins again. Throughout we are continually aware of the body.Recommended reading – “The Blooming of the Lotus”, “The Miracle of Mindfulness”, both by Thich Nhat Hanh.",

We gather together to practice sitting and walking meditation, share our joys and difficulties during Dharma Sharing, and to encourage each other on the path of practice. During these evenings we regularly drink tea together and sing songs accompanied by guitar. Our group welcomes practitioners of all traditions and experience levels to practice mindfulness in comunity. It is necessary that you speak at least a basic level of German.Currently, we are a stable group of 5-6 people ranging from anywhere between 25 and above 40 years of age. However, because we move to a new and bigger room this summer, we are in the process of raising awareness of our sangha, so that we can practice with even more friends. The new room will be only a few minutes from our current room and more towards the direction of Münster's city centre.",

At every session we practise sitting and walking meditation, we read out a fragment of Thay's books and we have a Dharma sharing about our being both queer and Dharma practicioners, cultivating deep listening and loving speech. We meet every 2nd and 4th Friday of the month. We regularly organise mindful days and special thematic meetings to deepen our practise. As we are the only sangha designed for LGBTQIA+ in Italy, we also offer our siblings from outside Florence to attend our sessions online.",

We follow the Five Mindfulness Trainings and read them regularly supporting it with recitation of other Thay writings. At the meetings we have 20 minutes of sitting meditation, 20 minutes of walking meditation and 20 minutes of lying meditation followed by Dharma sharing. We organize Humanum Mindfulness Days when we cook, eat,clean and watch Thay's lectures together and follow the 20-20-20 practice scheme twice a day.
