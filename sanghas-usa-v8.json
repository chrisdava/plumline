We are family and kid friendly, with weekly children's activities (both together with and separate from adults). In the warmer months we meet outside. The general Sangha format starts with both children and adults signing practice songs, followed by group walking meditation, then a short guided meditation from the Plum Village app. Then the children separate for their own program while the adults practice silent sitting meditation, followed by a Dharma offering and ending with a focus on Dharma Sharing. Dharma Offerings are: 1st Sunday - 5 MT recitation, 2nd Sunday - Chanting or Touching the Earth, 3rd Sunday - Children's Program for all, 4th Sunday - Discourse Reading, 5th Sunday - Deep Relaxation.",
