We currently are doing book studies (currently We Were Made For These Times book) and basic sitting meditation. My goal is to build a regular weekly practice of Sitting, Walking, Silent meditation, followed by a Dharma Talk (using books, articles, or videos by Thay and others) to offer a deeper lesson then community discussion time to share. I'd like to offer tea in our discussion time. As we grow I would like to start having Quarterly Days of Mindfulness. I would eventually like to build an annual retreat for the DFW community as we do not have anything like this locally yet. I will be leaning on OI and Dharma Teachers when we get to that stage but right now it is only myself facilitating.",
